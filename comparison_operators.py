# Python examples of comparison operators
# == is used as a comparison operator, it checks if the values on either side of the operator are equal
# If they are equal than its true, if not than its false


#Equality

a = 15
b = 65
print(a ==b)

#Inequality

print( a!= b)

#greater than

print(a > b)

#less than

print(a < b)

# comparing two values

x = 5
y = 5

# even the indentation and double columns are critical to effectoive code
if x == y:
    print("x and y are equal")
else:
    print("x and y are not equal")
